# What is Tabrador?
A Web Extension written for Firefox (in theory should work on Chrome too) inspired by the marvellous [LinkClump](https://github.com/benblack86/linkclump).

# What does it do?
It allows you to right-click and drag to select any number of hyperlinks on your page which you want to open. When you release the right-click button, all selected links will be opened in new background tabs. Woof.
